# Kickstarter Challenge

### Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze different campaigns to help generate insights for Louise's campaign. The data contained many different types of campaigns, goals, pledged amount, and a short summary of each campaign. This data helped in the analysis by showing pattens such as different outcomes based on goals and categories. The data can easily be filtered to get the insights usedful for many different categories. 

### Analysis and Challenges
I was able to perform my analysis by filtering  data using the description of what Louise was looking for. I did this by finding campaigns that are similar and seeing which ones were sucsessful, what time of year they were most sucsessful, and at what goals did they have the most sucsess. This will allow Louise to make the best decsions when creating his own campaigns.

### Results
Two conclusions I can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that they do best in May, although there is a rise in failed campaigns there is a higher percentage that does well during that time. This higher sucsess rate flows into August. December is the worst time to launch a campaign. I can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals that campaigns do the best with samaller goals (particularly under $4,999) A goal of $4,999 and under shoud be what Louise aims for. The limitations on the data sets is that it does not contain a large amount of categories it also does not tell us mush about who or where the campaigns are recieving money from. This could be helpful in determining who would be most likely to spend money on a particular campaign. Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create that would be helpful is "Outcomes Based on Category" or "Size of the Organization vs Goal vs. Succsess Rate" this could help us determine the appropriate goal of Loiuse. Outcomes based on category could show other options that may be of intrest and how well they did.
